    passage: "The rise of remote work has fundamentally altered how organizations think about employee productivity. Whereas office presence once stood as a proxy for effort, firms are now measuring output by deliverables. Proponents argue this shift empowers workers with flexibility, reducing burnout and widening talent pools. Critics, however, warn that without in‑person oversight, collaboration can suffer and company culture may erode. Interestingly, hybrid models—combining on‑site days with remote days—have emerged as a popular compromise, seeking to balance autonomy with team cohesion.",

    passage: "Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant strides in natural language processing, enabling chatbots to handle customer queries with near‑human fluency. Nevertheless, these systems still struggle with context shifts and ambiguous user intents. To address this, many developers are integrating AI with rule‑based frameworks that provide guardrails—hardcoded rules that kick in when the model's confidence dips below a threshold. Early studies show that hybrid AI systems reduce error rates by up to 20%. As adoption grows, striking the right balance between flexibility and reliability remains the key challenge.",
